    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Yassine Hanini, a curious mind transitioning into a Java developer with a unique blend of experiences. I started with a degree in Physics, where I honed my analytical thinking by unraveling the universe’s mysteries. Later, I earned a diploma in Management, mastering organization and strategy skills I now bring to coding.</p>
    <p>Today, I’m diving into Java programming, driven by a love for problem-solving and creating efficient, impactful solutions. Whether it’s building robust applications or simplifying complex systems, I’m excited to shape the digital world, one line of code at a time. Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring new ideas be it through science, sketching, or staying updated on the latest innovations.</p>
